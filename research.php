                        This goal of this project is to develop and evaluate schedules for embedded systems, multi-core computers,
                        clusters and grids.  The target is to develop adaptable and scalable schedules that are resource aware (memory,
                            computational power) as well as energy and thermal conscious.</li>

                        This project investigates the use of secondary bus between cache and memory to develop better micro-architectures.
                        It also investigates the use of wireless technology to develop better fault tolerance and cache coherence techniques.
                            It involves performance analysis and hardware design.</li>

                        <li>
                            <span>Storage architecture:</span>
                        This project investigates novel data and meta-data organization within disks, disk-clusters and flash drives for better
                            timing, energy, fault tolerance and wear.</li>
